Common questions about the server will be answered here.

# World

#### Why aren't hostile mobs spawning?

On this server have have built a mobswitch for the overworld and nether, which will prevent hostile mobs from spawning in these areas while they're enabled. You can find the locations for these in the `#points-of-interest` channel in Discord.

#### Where is ...?

Check the pinned messages in the `#points-of-interest` channel in Discord.

#### Can I use this farm?

Most posts in the `#points-of-interest` channel should explain this, if not, feel free to ask, but assume that a farm is private unless otherwise said.

#### Where does 1.18+ terrain start generating?

A substantial amount of terrain has been generated before the new 1.18+ terrain was introduced, you should be able to get to the new terrain by going a 1 - 3 thousand blocks in a direction.

# Mods

#### Do I have to install mods to play on the server?

No, all the mods used are entirely server-side, however, it is recommended that you do use a [few select mods](new-player-guide/#mods--useful-tools) for the best experience.

#### How do I see shared schematics?

# Administration

#### How long will it take for me to be whitelisted?

This can vary greatly, if you've submitted an application be sure that it will be reviewed and discussed by staff.

#### What are the whitelist requirements?

These are currently not public.

#### How do I report a player?

You can send a direct message to a Minecraft server admin and it will be investigated as soon as possible.

#### How do I become a staff member?

You may be asked to become a staff member, we are not currently taking applications / looking for new staff members, so please do not ask.

# Misc

#### How does the Cam app work?

You can run `/cam` to enter spectator mode, and run it again to return to your last position. This does have some bugs, see below.

#### I lost all my XP

You can leave and rejoin the server and your XP should be restored.

#### I teleported across dimensions and have am lost / suffocating

Teleporting across dimensions is somewhat buggy, and can sometimes result in you being teleported into the void, into solid blocks, or large distances. If you do teleport across dimensions using Cam, then I recommend that you attempt to teleport back to your original dimension as this should fix any issues.

If you are suffocating in blocks, then an admin may be able to help you, although this is not guaranteed.
