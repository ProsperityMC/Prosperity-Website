Prosperity is a survival-multiplayer Minecraft server with a focus enabling players to work on large projects easily. To achieve this the server has many quality of life improvements, and changes that allow you to farm more items, and have an easier time than a vanilla server.

This website, and wiki, is currently a work in progress, please report any issues in the `#website` channel on Discord or on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ProsperityMC/Prosperity-Website/issues).
