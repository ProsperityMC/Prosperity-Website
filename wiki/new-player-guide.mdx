This guide intends to serve as a comprehensive introduction to the server, how to get started quickly, and have the best experience as a member of our community. Most discussion surrounding this server will occur on our Discord server, there you will find plenty of people willing to answer your questions and relevant announcements regarding events and changes to the server.

## What We Do Here

Depending on how you found out about the server you may not be sure what this server is or what your role here may be. In short, Prosperity is a survival server where we intend to bring together the best people from across the Minecraft player base to work together and do more. We utilize a number of additional [gameplay mechanics](/wiki/features) and encourage people to get creative beyond the limits of the standard game.

Most players on the server both contribute to and start community projects, as well as maintain a solo or group base. With a huge number of farms we don't maintain an active commercial area and resources are shared freely.

## Getting Started

As a new member of the server we recommend getting familiar with the Discord server and introducing yourself in the #prosperity channel. Feel free to ask any questions if you need help or would like a server tour. We also recommend checking out the #projects channel to see what the current community projects are. Don't hesitate to start a new thread if you have a good idea.

Once you've become settled on the server and start with your personal base, project, farms, or anything else we would love for you to take a screenshot and share it in the #progress-updates channel.

## Mods & Tools

You may join the server with a vanilla, Fabric, or Forge client, however our recommendation is that you use our [client modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/prosperity) which is pre-configured with all the most common mods people use for this server.

Even if you wish to make your own personal modpack, or largely avoid mods, it may be useful to gain some familiarity with the most common mods used by members of the community.

### Carpet

[Carpet](https://modrinth.com/mod/carpet) is the basis for the vast majority of the [new mechanics and features](/wiki/features) that have been added to the server. The mod is very stable and is completely intercompatible with vanilla, allowing the world to be run without mods, and features to be enabled and disabled at any time.

In addition to the base Carpet mod a huge number of extensions have been created, many of which we use, more on the [mods page](/wiki/mods).

### Litematica & Syncmatica

[Litematica](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematica) is Fabric mod which provides the ability to create and manipulate in-world schematics and precisely track their material requirements. This has a wide range of applications and is used by both technical players and builders.

[Syncmatica](https://modrinth.com/mod/syncmatica) is an separate extension which allows schematics to be uploaded and synced for multiple members on the server. This is most useful for large scale community projects.

### Simple Voice Chat & Audioplayer

[Simple Voice Chat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat) allows proximity voice chat via Minecraft for all of those who have the mod. Admittedly this feature does see limited use, however it may be nice to have for group projects.

[Audioplayer](https://modrinth.com/mod/audioplayer) is an extension to Simple Voice Chat allowing players to create and play back custom music discs.
