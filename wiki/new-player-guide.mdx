# Resources

In order to have the best experience on the server, you'll need to know where to get information.

## Discord

This is the most important place to be if you want to engage with the server. The latest information on new projects is always here, and you can ask members and staff questions that might not be listed anywhere else.

Whitelist applications are managed via this server so you should already be here.

## Wiki / website

You probably already know about this, since you're reading it. This site is frequently updated with the latest information, and, in my humble opinion, has a great user experience.

[Website](https://prosperity.vercel.app/)

## GitHub

All of Prosperity's associated projects, such as our resource pack, the source code for this website, and any future development related projects are hosted through our GitHub organization.

# Mods & useful tools

You can join the server using a vanilla client, or with whatever mods you wish. However, for the best experience I would recommend downloading, or at least being aware of the following mods. These are frequently used by members, and their functionality will be helpful on the server.

## Simple Voice Chat

Prosperity supports in-game proximity chat through the Simple Voice Chat mod.

## Litematica

It is highly recommended that you familiarize yourself with Litematica. This mod allows you to create an in-game overlay for a structure, which you can use as a guide for building. This is very important for technical gameplay, and is used as a collaboration tool on the server.

### Syncmatica

Syncmatica is an addon to Litematica that allows you to share your schematics with other members on the server. This is convenient for large scale community projects, so that you aren't the person who builds off by one block.

Note that you need to use both mods together in order for them to work.

## Carpet

Carpet is used on the server to add additional gameplay features. You don't need this mod in order to play, but it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with it's features. This mod will be good to have if you wish to test something in singleplayer.

You can learn more about exactly which features are being used, and find configuration files on the [mods page](/wiki/tweaks-and-changes).

## Tweakeroo

Tweakeroo contains a very large amount of survival utilities, these range from freecam to autoclickers, to the ability to disable entity rendering. It is highly recommended that you use this mod, to make your life easier, and make collaboration with the players that already do use it much better.

_Yes you can use freeccam on this server. See the rules for more information._

## MiniHUD

MiniHUD is a mod that gives you additional information about your game. This includes a compact and configurable information overlay (like the F3 screen), or 3D shape overlays in game.

## OptiFine alternatives

This is a Fabric server, and most of these mods are only available for Fabric. It is not recommended that you use OptiFine for various reasons. You can learn why, and what you can do to replace the mod's functionality on the [OptiFine alternatives](/wiki/optifine-alternatives) page.

# On the server

Here is some information you might find useful when joining the server for the first time.

## Bases

Prosperity is heavily focused around individual bases, similar to servers like Hermitcraft. You are free to build in whatever style or scale you wish. This server has no themed districts, plots, or defined places to put anything, you are free to explore and start your base wherever you would like.

## Points of interest

If you're looking for a specific farm, base, or biome, there's a good chance it already exists. You can check the `#points-of-interest` channel on Discord, or the [wiki page with the same name](/wiki/points-of-interest), which contain a list of farms and builds which you should be aware of.

### Important points of interest

Some of the most important places to know are:

- The commercial district @ `-289 74 -794 OW` / `-38 128 -97 Nether`
- The overworld hostile mob switch @ `300 255 130 Nether`
- The Nether hostile mob switch @ `651 222 133 Nether`

## Commerce

If you wish to buy, sell, or trade with other players, then it's important to know about commerce. The server has a dedicated commercial district where players can build shops and sell items. Typically the currency used is diamonds. Any player is free to build a shop, without paying or restrictions.

If you wish to ask for a specific order, or want things for free, you are free to send a message in the `#commerce` channel on Discord.

## Creative server

Finally, if you wish to collaborate on projects in creative, you can join the creative server with WorldEdit and useful commands available. This server also has the latest configs, so anything that works on the creative server will also work in creative.
