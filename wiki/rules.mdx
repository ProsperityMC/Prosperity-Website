As a member of Prosperity you are expected to abide by these rules. The size of our community permits that we handle infractions on a case-by-case basis, but this also means that there is no chance for you to get away with loopholes or repeatedly getting away with causing trouble.

Our overall goal is to create an experience where people can self-moderate and conversations and gameplay can naturally emerge, without the looming threat of losing months or years of progress to an obscure rules violation. Each member of the administration team is trusted to make judgement calls and moderation actions as they see fit, but if you would like any clarification or have any concerns you may reach out to anyone on the admin team directly.

## 1. Engaging With Others

1. **Moderate the things you post.** You may feel free to use profanity, but please be aware that this server does allow anyone over 13 to join. Absolutely no posting explicit pornography or gore.
2. **Maintain yourself and others' privacy.** Avoid sharing anyone's personal information. Be aware that we keep a log of message edits and deletions.
3. **Bigotry and hate speech are not tolerated.** If you choose to be an awful person on or off the server we will see you removed.
4. **Refrain from low-effort posting.** Please avoid spamming messages, images, and reactions with no intention of promoting discussion.

## 2. Engaging With The World

1. **Respect the world.** If you break a public or another person's build it is your responsibility to make it right. Do you best to leave things nicer than you found them.
2. **Perform due-diligence in following player instructions.** Including documentation, in-game signage and books, and other messaging. If you are unsure how to use a machine or farm and break it, that's on you.
3. **Don't cause harm to other players.** Don't steal items, grief or change other's builds, or repeatedly troll other players. If you kill another player you are responsible for any damages.
4. **Do not cheat or exploit.** Duping, using mods which give you unreasonable advantages, performing exploits which may violate other rules, or otherwise cheating is not allowed.

Because of the nature of the server some mods which may be considered cheating on other servers, such as Tweakeroo, are allowed here. If you have any questions about this please ask.

## 3. Exceptions & Clarifications

-   Item duplication is disallowed, however entity duplication for TNT and item duplication for the Dragon Egg specifically are excepted.
